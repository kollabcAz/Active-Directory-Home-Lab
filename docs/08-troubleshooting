[1.During installation Windows-10-Pro-Client]

So during the installation of Windows 10 Pro i encountered the first error, which tells me that it isnt able too boot properly.

First i've added one more core, because it might caused because it could lack of Processor-performance.

After trying again, the error still appears, so i powered off and startet the Win-Client. I immediatly pressed a key to restart the installation again.

[2.On Client, DNS isnt given as it should be]

Next Error happend while trying to connect the Client with the Domain, lab.local. While an Error-Message appeared, as be seen in the followibg picture:
![Error: Domain couldn't be found](screenshots/44-error-domain-could-not-be-found.png)

As i proceed with checking if the DNS is matching, i saw by typing in: "ipconfig /all" 
that the output didnt give out the right IP, as actually no DNS was given at all.

I then powered on the DC, and checked if the right DNS frequently was shouted out, on the DHCP scope. I navigated to "Server Manager" -> "Tools" -> "DHCP" -> clicked on the Server and went through "IPv4" to "Scope" then to given-"Scope" and to "Scope options" as well as looked out for "006 DNS Servers". But the DNS seems right by now.

To be clear about the given DNS as it matches with the DC's IP, i headed over to the CMD and typed in: "ipconfig". And it also confirms the match between DC's IP with the DNS. So by now, it factors out the "DNS incompability".

As i parallel, tested "nslookup lab.local", it gave out the right dns, by now.

So now, it may be able to connect due to powerring on the DC.
