Next, I opened the Server Manager Dashboard and selected “Add Roles and Features.”
Under Server Roles, I chose Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS).

I also selected Domain Name System (DNS) Server to ensure proper name resolution within the domain environment.

After the required roles were installed, I proceeded to promote the server to a Domain Controller using the post-deployment configuration wizard.

During the domain controller promotion process, I configured the server to create a new forest.

I then defined the Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM) password, which is required for recovery and maintenance operations.

The automatically generated NetBIOS domain name was reviewed and kept unchanged.

After confirming the configuration settings, the installation process began. Upon completion, the system performed an automatic restart to finalize the domain controller setup.
