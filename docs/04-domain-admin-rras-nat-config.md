Via "Tools"->"Active Directory Users and Computers"->rightclick on "lab.local" and choosing "New"->Organisational Unit,
i've created an UO called "AdminAccounts". Then by clicking on this UO and selecting "create a current User in the current container" I've set the "User logon name" also like the First- Last- and Full name.
Following with choosing the destinated password i've also unchecked "User must change password at next logon" and checked the box "password never expires".

Lastly, by rightclicking (or doubleclicking) on destinated User i navigated to "Member of" and clicked on "Add..." to type in "Domain Admin" in the large Textfield, the "object name to select"-field.
